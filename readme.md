# Diabetes Classification 

## Abstract 
Approximately 34.2 million people in America suffer from diabetes. My goal was to try and predict whether someone is likely to get diabetes before they even have it. The dataset that I worked with allows me to do exactly that. The features it contains includes sudden weight loss, visual blurring, weakness, and many more that can help classify whether someone will have diabetes or not. Since my goal was classification, I wanted to choose between the decision tree and random forest in terms of which one will yield the best results. Once the analysis was complete, the random forest was found to be the best machine learning technique to utilize for this dataset.
